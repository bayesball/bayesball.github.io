For a specific season, look at all hitters with say at least 50 at-bats. Does the association pattern between In-Play Rate and BACON change when you select players with at least 400 at-bats?

There are separate curves for the 2019 and 2021 seasons. The bottom graph displays parallel density graphs of the adjusted spray angle for the two seasons.\nComparing the 2019 and 2021 seasons …\n\nWe see that generally the 2021 hit rates are smaller than the 2019 hit rates for pulled ground balls and balls hit to the opposite side smaller than 12 degrees. The differences are greatest for balls hit at -20 and 0 degrees.\nThe 2019 hit rates are smaller than the 2021 rates for opposite side ground balls between 12 and 22 degrees.\nThe bottom graph confirms that most of the ground balls are hit to the pull side."

Large values of pitch values, colored red, favor the pitcher and small values, colored blue, favor the batter.\nFor the snapshot above, we are selecting Gerrit Cole and the four-seam fastball. Looking at the pitch location display, I see a general tendency for Cole to throw high and outside, both to left-handed and right-handed hitters. The pitch value display indicates that four-seam fastballs thrown high in the zone to left-handed hitters tend to have the highest positive pitch values favoring the pitcher.\nTo get alternative graphs, make button selections and press the MAKE PLOT button.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we again choose Gerrit Cole and choose the pitch type to be slider (SI).

    "text": "23.2 Using the PredictHomeRuns App\nOne first selects a Model Season – a model is fit predicting home run rates for a given month using a smooth function of the launch variables for that season.\nNext one selects future seasons to predict, and a particular month of interest. Pressing the RUN button will implement the prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the Model Season is 2018, the month of interest is May, and one is predicting home run rates for Mays of 2019, 2021, and 2022.\nThe top graph shows the home run rate in May 2018 (blue line) and the observed home run rate in May 2019 (black line). The red curve displays the prediction distribution for the 2019 rate from the 2018 model.\nThe prediction distribution is above the 2018 rate – this indicates that the batters are hitting at high exit velocities and better launch angles in 2019. But the 2019 rate is higher than the prediction distribution. This indicates that the baseball has more carry in 2019 than in 2018. Similar intepretations can be made for the middle and bottom graphs"

The estimate of the precision parameter K is 263.836 – this indicates how much the observed rate is shrunk towards 0.251.\nBy clicking on the Rates tab, one sees parallel dotplots of the observed and multilevel predictions.

One can brush over the scatterplot and the table displays the corresponding pitchers. Here we look at pitchers who faced Jeter at least 100 PA with the smallest wOBA estimates.
