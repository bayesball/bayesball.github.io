- He received the second-most walks (2190) of any player in history.

2.  Page 16. Figure 2.3.  Some of the team abbreviations are placed at the wrong locations.  

a.  Under the National League, the symbols CHC PIT MIL WAS are next to the "15" line.

b.  Under the American League, the symbol SEA should be next to the "13" line.

c.  Under the American League, the symbols CHW DET LAA should be next to the "15" line.


3.  Page 194, Table 8.5

The heading for Table 8.5 says "Situational on-base percentages of Rickey Henderson for the 1990 season."  -- actually it is the 1999 season.
